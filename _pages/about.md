I am a machine learning scientist at [Seismic Therapeutic](https://seismictx.com/), a machine learning immunology company, building models that are aware of symmetries, geometries and physics. I am currently working at the intersection of graphs, optimization, equivariant representations and 3D structure modeling plus some diffusion. I code in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), Python and C++. 


I got my PhD in [Applied Physics from Cornell University](https://www.aep.cornell.edu/aep), supervised by [Prof. Lois Pollack](https://pollack.research.engineering.cornell.edu/) with a minor in Applied Statistics. I studied nucleic acid structures and dynamics with X-ray scattering and computational/ML integrations. Some of my work was published in [PNAS](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026656118) and [Science Advances](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf6106). The recording of my virtual defense can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaiaH-bjD10).


After PhD, I joined [ReviveMed](https://www.revivemed.io/), an AI-driven drug discovery company, as a (senior) computational biologist, working on knowledge graphs, optimizations, statistical testing of graphs, graph neural networks and biomarker discovery. 


I enjoy solving puzzles; [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is one of my favorite. [Here](https://github.com/jipq6175/advent_of_code_2021) are example solutions in Julia for 2021. I also enjoy mathematical derivations, e.g. LASSO oracle inequality ([writeup](https://github.com/jipq6175/MATH7740/blob/master/SL-yc2253.pdf), [simulation](https://github.com/jipq6175/MATH7740/blob/master/simulation.jl)).


I am always creating, hacking, learning, and exploring.
